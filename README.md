# TimePickerDialogApp
This app uses a button to access the TimePicker. Unfortunately, it is not straightforward, as "hourX" and "minuteX" first return integers that may be only one digit long (instead of two), and hours are in 24-hour format. Also, AM and PM are not shown unless more code is added. Thus, more code was added to format things and make sure that everything looks good.
